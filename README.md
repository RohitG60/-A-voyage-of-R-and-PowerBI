## 💡 Key Insights and Learnings

### 1. **Data Import & Analysis in R Studio** 🖥️

In **R Studio**, I cleaned and manipulated the dataset to prepare it for analysis. I used various packages like `dplyr` and `ggplot2` to explore and transform the data, uncovering valuable insights about the Hollywood movie industry.

### 2. **Visualisation in Power BI** 📊

Once the data was prepped in R, I imported it into **Power BI** to create a series of interactive dashboards. These visualisations highlighted the factors contributing to a movie’s success, such as profitability and ratings across different genres and studios.

### 3. **Key Metrics Explored** 📉

By focusing on important metrics, we were able to:

- Identify the **most profitable genres** 🏆.
- Compare **studio performance** across years 🏢.
- Analyse the impact of **ratings on profitability** ⭐.

### 4. **Insights for Film Production & Marketing** 🎬

Through this project, I uncovered trends that can be used to inform future decisions in the film industry, including:

- Which genres are consistently more profitable.
- How studio-specific strategies affect a movie's success.
- How to better align movie ratings and marketing efforts to maximise profitability.
